## Who are we?

We are an independent initiative with the mission to publish and disseminate innovative knowledge on Africa to strengthen the understanding of humanity. Our aim is to promote a broader understanding of Africa and its people by providing a platform for authors to express new, alternative and daring perspectives and views on people, places, events, and issues shaping our world. We engage authors to go beyond existing realities to chart new terrains and domains of knowledge production.

We target a wider readership of scholars, academics, students, and other readers seeking to know more about their lives and societies. We cover monographs, textbooks, journals and literary writing.
We publish primarily in English and in French, and are willing to consider initiatives and ideas to disseminate in Portuguese and other African languages with a potential for wider distribution.

## Where are we?

We are headquartered in Dakar, Senegal, whose creative spirits and vibrancy provide stimulants for our production processes and expertise, drawn from within and the world over.

Amalion Publishing is a division of Amalion Sarl, a limited liability company registered in Senegal.
