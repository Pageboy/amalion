We are committed to publishing works of high quality and originality on Africa and its Diaspora for wider distribution on the continent and the world over. We cover monographs, textbooks, journals and literary writing and welcome contributions of proposals and completed manuscripts in various fields:

- Art, Literature, Music and Culture Studies
- Development Studies and International Relations
- History and the science of history making
- Language and Linguistics
- Philosophy
- Politics
- Psychology
- Religious Studies
- Social Sciences

At Amalion we publish only what we like and can promote; currently, that is a very limited number of titles programmed each year. Kindly contact us beforehand to know more about our editorial policy before any submission of manuscripts.

## Submitting a book proposal

Whether it is an author's monograph or a collection of essays by different authors under the editorship of one or more scholars, we will require that you send us an initial proposal with the following basic information:

- A preliminary description or overview, preferably not longer than two pages, including the tentative title and subtitles and if available, a table of contents. This summary should focus on your book's subject and give an idea of how that subject is developed or from which perspective/s it is being approached.
- A succinct authors'/editors' information sheet highlighting your qualifications, affiliations and academic background. In the case of a collection of essays by different authors around a central subject, add the contributors' affiliations.
- Marketing information describing the prospective readership for your book. If possible, provide names of institutions, courses, and programmes that can be targeted.
- Authors'/editors' originality versus marketplace competition: list recently published books that would compete with yours and, if possible, provide a brief synopsis describing these titles. Mention how your proposed book will be different from the other titles.
- For new potential series, we are open to proposals from scholars who are well informed about current research and in tune with the latest developments within their specific academic fields or disciplines. We are especially interested in research that does not follow trends but anticipates new directions, and in projects aimed at further broadening knowledge beyond academia.
- Your manuscript. If already completed, specify the total number of pages, including index, references and all other sections. Provide information about illustrated material or any other special graphic features that might be required. If your project is in progress, give us an estimated date of completion and delivery, and approximate total length.

Upon receipt, we will consider your proposal and decide whether to go further with it and then we will request that you send the complete manuscript. If we have not specifically requested for a complete manuscript, we enjoin you to send the complete manuscript only after we have expressed interest in your proposal.

Once you have sent us the manuscript, the subsequent period of consideration by the editorial board is approximately two to three months. During this period we expect you to refrain from simultaneous or multiple submissions to other publishers.

## Submitting a journal proposal

We welcome propositions of journal titles from scholarly and professional associations, academic institutions and faculty members, and non-governmental organizations working on Africa.

Journals provide a critical media for scholarly disciplines to effectively cover current development and thinking in their various disciplines. For scholarly and professional associations, journals can provide more than a platform for debate but also a lifeline to bring together practitioners and members of the discipline and the general public.

Journal management is however a highly complex endeavour that requires top-notch process to effectively maximise its potential. Journal titles require much more than excellent content and eminent editorial boards to survive an extremely constricted publishing terrain and dwindling library resources.

At Amalion Publishing we can provide the required advice and suggestions to establishing a viable and sustainable journal publishing programme. Key elements in our expertise that we can share include the following:

- A feasibility study of the potential of the journals in the market place, including refining its focus, objectives and readership.
- Draw up a management plan and programme for the journal title, including setting up a journal management platform for the journal covering the entire publishing process from submission, peer review to production and dissemination.
- Design and undertake an appropriate technical production format, subscription and distribution model for the journal.
- Market and promote the journal to ensure optimum visibility and impact among prospective users in the discipline and worldwide.
- Develop a system for feedback and for monitoring the journal’s impact among its readership.
