**Kathryn Nwajiaku-Dahou**

Dr Kathryn Nwajiaku-Dahou is the Director of ODI’s Politics and Governance programme and a member of ODI’s Leadership Team. She has been a widely acknowledged expert on conflict, fragility and governance as well as business and human rights for 25 years, about which she has written extensively. A common thread in her thinking is the importance of applying a shrewd political lens to understanding ‘developing country’ contexts as ‘complex’ political societies, interrogating knowledge production and the development project itself.

Before joining ODI, Kathryn worked for the OECD for five years, as Head of Unit and Head of the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Secretariat and previously worked for the Irish Government and spent eight years as a researcher and policy advisor for Oxfam and ACORD, where she worked in and on politics and conflict in East (Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania) and West Africa (Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria). Kathryn has worked with various bilateral and multilateral institutions, including DFID (FCDO), Danida and AfDB, as an independent consultant. Kathryn is currently Chair of the Bayelsa State Oil and Environmental Commissions’ Expert Working Group in Nigeria, and is a member of the Board of Trustees of UK NGO, RAID (Rights and Accountability in Development).

Kathryn has an MA from the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies, specialising on Africa, an MSc in Politics Research Methods and a DPhil in Politics and International Relations from Nuffield College, University of Oxford, where she also held two post-doctoral research positions (2006–2012). Kathryn is also a poet.
