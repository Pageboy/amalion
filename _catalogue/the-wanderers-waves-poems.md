## Tade Aina

“Rich-veined, sensual, and probing, this rewarding collection bears the imprint of a keen, world-wise poet. Tade Aina is a well-traveled man who weaves the lore, legends and histories of hearth and far-flung places with equal self-assurance.” **– Okey Ndibe,** author of *Foreign Gods, Inc.* (Soho Press 2014).

“Tade Aina’s book, *The Wanderer’s Waves*, is an outstanding poetic chronicle of a trailblazer’s explorations, observations and experiences across the world, from the Americas to Zimbabwe and from the early years of youth.  The composition style is a combination of traditional, renaissance and modernist archetypes in postcolonial poetic rendition. The poems, in total, also have a universal community spirit and reflectively speak to our blessed multiple identities as humans, while shedding clear light on the ties that bind humanity, such as ties to nature and mobility.” **– Akwasi Aidoo,** author of *Rhythms of Dignity* (Amalion 2020).

“Travel, landscapes, people, the territories of the senses, of the heart. “Life, for him a geography of minutes”. Echoes from the experiences of the restless soul about the world, whose work also turns him into an eavesdropper, the fly-on-the-wall insights. In this body of work, to be gently savoured, the reader will encounter the dimensions of worlds, refracted in a most refreshing way.” – **Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor,** author of *Dust* (Granta 2015).
