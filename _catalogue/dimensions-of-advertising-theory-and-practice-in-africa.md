## Rotimi Williams Olatunji and Beatrice A. Laninhun (Eds.)

_Dimensions of Advertising Theory and Practice in Africa_ brings together cutting-edge research by leading African communication and media theorists to provide students of African advertising with a broad but detailed survey of the history and present state of the art in Africa.

For teachers and researchers, the book is a thought-provoking reminder of the variety of approaches to the study of marketing communication on a continent where advertising is often taken for granted. From indigenous African forms of advertising by street criers, wall paintings and even olfactory appeals to the latest experiments in integrated marketing communication via the Internet, home videos, smartphones and social media, _Dimensions of Advertising_ _Theory and Practice_ is a comprehensive survey both of Africa’s contributions to the globalized advertising industry and of the industry’s profound impact on African economies and cultures.

The first collection of its kind, _Dimensions of Advertising Theory and Practice_ marks an important moment in the study of marketing communication in Africa. It will be an essential text for years to come.
