Through his experiences, we learn valuable lessons about combating poverty, transforming economies at their core, and guiding nations through conflict and crisis. His narrative offers both inspiration and practical wisdom for those seeking to make a meaningful impact in the world.” – **Abdoulaye Mar Dièye** is the United Nations Under-Secretary-General, and Special Coordinator for Development in the Sahel.

 *“My Journey of Purpose* by André François Carvalho chronicles an extraordinary journey from humble beginnings in Ziguinchor, Senegal, to a distinguished career at the United Nations. The author explores his remarkably rich professional journey and a life of excellence lived with simplicity and humility in the service of the most vulnerable. Through his introspective and analytical writing style, he masterfully weaves together personal experiences with professional insights, creating a coherent narrative while offering profound reflections on the personal and professional dimensions of his international development career. He truly represents an inspiring example for future generations.” – **Robert Beugré Mambé,** Prime Minister of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.
