## Anthonia Makwemoisa (Ed.)

_The HerStory Project_ is a stirring kaleidoscope of thirty-three exemplary women from different backgrounds, temperaments, passions, and achievements. The stories of these women, drawn from Botswana, Ghana, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe, challenge and move beyond long-held traditions of gender discrimination and cultural inhibitions to reveal individuals whose determination and self-belief have had tremendous impact on their livelihoods, communities and nations. These narratives redefine and delineate the contours of women empowerment and leadership in African communities, broadening the discourse to include the transformative power of the individual and her society.
