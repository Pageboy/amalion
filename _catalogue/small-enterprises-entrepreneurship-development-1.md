## Enyinna Chuta (Ed.)

The increasing numbers of college and university graduates from Africa’s tertiary institutions and the declining prospects for jobs in the public and private sector have reinforced the importance of creating avenues for self-employment. But job creation exposes a serious gap in education policies, for basic skills in entrepreneurship are not taught in most tertiary curricula across the continent. This nineteen-chapter volume provides essential course text material for developing the field of entrepreneurship in tertiary institutions, thus addressing the issue of appropriate pedagogy critical for the emerging field of entrepreneurship development in higher education institutions in Africa. Drawing from Nigeria, West Africa and other parts of the developing world, the volume furnishes much needed empirical information to fashion out appropriate policies and projects within macroeconomic framework to nurture small and medium enterprises as a development tool.
