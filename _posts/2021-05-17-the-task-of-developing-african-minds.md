Created by a publisher in Senegal and an author based in Niger, the Sarraounia Prize is accepting manuscripts for young adult readers.

A new biennial YA award, the [Sarraounia Prize](http://www.sarraounia.com/), has been announced for published and unpublished authors and illustrators based in Africa.

Organizers are calling for entries, with applications open now (July 26) to September 30.

Adebowale’s publishing company, [Amalion,](http://www.amalion.net/) publishes in French and English and is based in Dakar. Tidjani Alou is a scholar and author who leads the [Arts and Culture](https://www.facebook.com/ARTS-Culture-236248510190137/)training program at Abdou Moumouni University in Niamey, Niger.
