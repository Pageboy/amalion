On the 30th September 2015, the book *Wala Bok: Une histoire orale du hip hop au Sénégal* by Fatou Kandé Senghor was presented to the public at the *Goethe-Institute* in Dakar, Senegal. In it, Senghor talks about her love of hip-hop and its influence on Senegalese, music, and culture.

 Senghor touched on such subjects as the importance of the book to the local community, the position of women in Senegalese hip-hop, the evolution of language, her influences (such as Daara J, Duggy Tee, etc), and many more aspects. The event closed with a testimony to the art form and a performance from local rap artist Matador.
