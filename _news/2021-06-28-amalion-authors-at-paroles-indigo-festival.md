Three Amalion titles featured at this year’s edition of *Paroles Indigo*, a literary and artistic festival of voices from around the world. Fatou Kandé Senghor (*Wala Bok: Une Histoire orale du hip hop au Sénégal*), Kevin Eze (*The Peacekeeper’s Wife*), and the late Kofi Awoonor (The Promise of Hope) represented by Sulaiman Adebowale. The festival, which took place in the historic Roman city of Arles, France, ran from 30th October until the 2nd November 2015.

The festival gathered artists, musicians, publishers, and writers from Europe, Africa,, and the Middle East. Fatou Kandé Senghor and Sulaiman Adebowale joined Boubacar Boris Diop at the inaugural plenary hosted by Hervé Schiavetti, Mayor of Arles, at the Hôtel de ville. The Centre for Translation hosted bilingual readings from Sika Fakambi and Adebowale of extracts of the works of Kofi Awoonor and Kevin Eze among other events.
