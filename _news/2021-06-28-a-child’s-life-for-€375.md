Fahmida Khan, the writer for Pambazuka News, reviews Tina Okpara’s eye-opening memoir ‘My Life has a Price’. Pambazuka News is a pan-African community dedicated to the promotion of social justice in Africa. Here is an excerpt of the review:

“In the grim world of human trafficking, Nigeria is just one of the many African countries where girls in their adolescence are exploited for the purposes of forced labor and sexual abuse. Equally, many people from these same countries are eager to move away from their native land with the hope of escaping repression, whether it be based on gender, religion, social or economic factors. They want freedom and independence. However, this is the irony of Tina’s story.”
