Dr. Akinwumi Ogundiran, professor of Africana Studies, Anthropology & History at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte (USA), presents a review of professor Adebanji Akintoye’s *A History of the Yoruba People.* Here is an excerpt:

*“The History of the Yoruba People* was the first attempt, more than a hundred years ago, to provide a comprehensive history of the Yoruba peoples from their origins as a cultural-ethnic community to the present. It was a hugely successful volume, and it is still in print! Yet, so much has been done since then by scholars of different stripes to advance Yoruba historiography. No one has however matched Johnson’s comprehensive volume with a new history for a new age. That was until now.”
