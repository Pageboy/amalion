The submission period for the Book Prize kicked off on September 15 and will run until November 15, 2012. It costs nothing to enter! To read how to submit to the prize, click [here](http://africanpoetrybf.unl.edu/?page_id=21) (<http://africanpoetrybf.unl.edu/?page_id=21>) or follow the guidelines below:

\* Eligibility: The Sillerman First Book Prize for African Poets will only accept “first book” submissions from African writers who have not published a book-length poetry collection. An “African writer” is taken to mean someone who was born in Africa, who is a national or resident of an African country, or whose parents are African. Only poetry written in English is eligible, although translated poetry will be accepted and a percentage of the prize awarded to the translator.

\* When to send: Manuscripts will be accepted between September 15 and November 15, 2012.

\* Manuscript: Poetry manuscripts should be at least 50 pages long. The author’s name should not appear on the manuscript. All entries will be read anonymously. Include a cover page listing only the title of the manuscript. You may submit more than one manuscript.

\* Fee: There is no entry fee for this contest.

\* Notification: The winner will be announced on the African Poetry Book Fund website on or before January 1.
