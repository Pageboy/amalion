We are saddened to announce the passing of distinguished poet and novelist Kofi Awoonor. He died in the terrorist attack by al-Shabaab militants at the Westgate shopping mall on 21 September 2013 in Nairobi, Kenya.

Born George Awoonor Williams on 13 March 1935 in Wheta, the southeastern part of Ghana, **Kofi Nyidevu Awoonor** was a diplomat, a professor of comparative literature at numerous universities, and recently retired from teaching full-time in the Department of English at the University of Ghana.

He published several volumes of poetry, including *Rediscovery and Other Poems* (1964), under his initial name George Awoonor Williams, *Night of My Blood* (1971), *Ride Me, Memory* (1973), *The House by the Sea* (1978) a product of his time as a political prisoner without trial, and *The Latin American and Caribbean Notebook* (1992). His collected poems (through 1985) were published in *Until the Morning After* (1978)*.* He also published two novels *This Earth, My Brother* (1971) and *Voyager at Last* (1992). He studied at the University of Ghana, Legon; University of London, UK; and SUNY in the US.

A state memorial service will be held on 11 October and a final laying to rest on 9 November 2013 in his hometown, Wheta, Ghana. He is survived by his wife and six children.
