**In conversation:** *My Life Has a Price* by Tina Okpara

Lagos Book and Art Festival

Tina Okpara's memoir, MY LIFE HAS A PRICE, takes us on her 5-year journey to hell; from a loving yet poor childhood in Nigeria to the ordeal of modern-day slavery in wealthy, suburban Paris. She was only 13 when celebrity footballer, Godwin Okpara and his wife Linda, lured her father into giving her up for a supposedly better life in Europe. Tina Okpara will share from that experience, especially on writing the memoir and the healing it brings.

Time: 10.00–11.45 prompt

Venue: Freedom Park, 1 Broad Street/Hospital Road, Lagos, Nigeria

Autographed copies of the book will be available for sale at the venue at a discounted launch price of 2500 naira at the Amalion stand at the fair.
