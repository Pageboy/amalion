Amalion was at the Frankfurt Book fair between 11 and 22 October 2023, an auspicious event this year to celebrate the publishing Meccaâ€™s 75th anniversary as a unique forum for book actors the world over.

Our participation this year was made possible by the Frankfurt Invitation programme, which gathers around 20 publishers from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe and Latin America in an intensive and engaging setting for the book. The programme, founded since the 1970s, is curated and organised by Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH.
