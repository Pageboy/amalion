Amalion Publishing featured amongst other scholarly publishers at the Sixth European Conference on African Studies ([ECAS](http://www.ecas2015.fr/ "ECAS")). The event, which took place in Paris between 8 and 10 July 2015, serves as a platform for conversation on sciences and humanities in Africa as well as in the Diaspora. The theme of this year’s conference was 'Collective Mobilisations in Africa: Contestation, Resistance, Revolt'. The event was co-organised by the Institut des mondes africains (IMAF) and Les Afriques dans le monde (LAM). At the conference, Amalion exhibited alongside [L’Oiseau Indigo](http://www.loiseauindigo.fr/ "oiseau indigo")*,* a collective that distributes and promotes books of publishers from the African and Arab world.

As for Amalion’s presence at the conference, there was no time wasted in displaying fresh, new content. As well as selling, a new title for 2015, *Wala Bok: Une Histoire orale du hip hop au Sénégal*, was introduced as well as sold at the conference.
