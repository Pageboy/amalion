An article on Fatou Kandé Senghor’s new book *Wala Bok: Une histoire orale du hip hop au Sénégal* (2015) was published by RFI Musique. RFI Musique is a TV programme and website that delivers the latest news about French and African music.

In this review by Ariane Poissonier (writer at RFI Musique), she comments on the raw delivery of Fatou Kandé Senghor’s message through the book. Fatou Kandé Senghor, being an artist herself, is able to weave together the story of thirty years of inspired, innovative music from Senegal. The book’s thirteen chapters are separated into three parts: History, Community, and Identity/Culture. From this, we are then subject to discussions on politics, feminism, the music industry, and the importance of the rapper as a social and educational figure.
