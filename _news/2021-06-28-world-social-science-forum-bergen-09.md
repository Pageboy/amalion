Nearly a thousand scholars, researchers, and policymakers gathered at the historic city of Bergen, Norway from 10 to 12 May 2009 for the First World Social Science Forum. The event was convened by the [International Social Science Council](http://www.unesco.org/ngo/issc/ "ISSC") and co-organized by the University of Bergen and the [Rokkan Centre,](http://www.rokkan.uib.no/wssf/index.xpl "WSSF") Norway to reflect on the challenges of social research production around the theme of “One Planet, Worlds Apart” and the role of the social sciences in the construction of a better modern world.

At the forum, we participated in various sessions including the “The Possibilities and Pitfalls of Publishing Social Science Research in the Age of the Internet” and “The Marketisation of Social Science” organized by the [Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa,](http://www.codesria.org/ "CODESRIA") an apex pan-African research institution on the continent. Other significant forums covered debates on “Science Ethics” which looked at how best to have a common framework to ensure the integrity of research production and dissemination. The special warmth of the Hanseatic buildings and the people of Bergen complemented a truly memorable forum of reflection.
