His partner, Karen Omoniyi, has set up a campaign for a project in his name:

> *“During his lifetime Sky funded and supported numerous charities but especially the local secondary school in his hometown where he provided an annual financial donation to fund key projects. As so many people are asking about flowers or donations we have set up a go fund me page to facilitate a memorial at the school in his name which will provide a benefit to the students and the school. The family will also take great comfort in knowing that there is a memorial in Sky's name in an educational environment in his hometown in Nigeria. Donation to the gofundme campaign for a long lasting monument in his name can be sent to* *<https://www.gofundme.com/prof-tope-omoniyi-memorial-fund>* *"* – Karen Omoniyi
