Kwame Dawes, Guggenheim Fellow, and winner of the 2011 Barnes & Noble Writers for Writers Awardis pleased toannounce the establishment of the African Poetry Book Fund. Starting in January 2014, the Series will publish four new titles by African poets each year. In addition, the Series will publish an anthology every few years representing themes, ideas, and poets from across the African continent. Of the four books published, one will be a winner of the Sillerman First Book Prize for African Poets, and the second will be a new and selected volume by a major African poet. The winner of the Sillerman prize will also receive $1000 in cash.

Ghanaian poet, Kofi Awoonor, is honored to be the first major poet in the Series. His new and selected poems, with an introduction by fellow poet and scholar, Kofi Anyidoho, will be published in 2014.

This new, exciting Series has been made possible through seed funding from philanthropists, Laura and Robert F. X. Sillerman, whose generous contributions have facilitated the establishment of the African Poetry Book Fund. Mr. and Mrs. Sillerman welcome the use of their name for the Sillerman First Book Prize for African Poets.

The African Poetry Book Series will be the central feature of the work of the African Poetry Book Fund, established in July 2012 under Dawes’ leadership at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. An Advisory Board has been established to support and guide the work of the African Poetry Book Fund. Confirmed Board Members include Laura Sillerman (President, The Tomorrow Foundation), Sulaiman Adebowale (Publisher, Amalion Publishing), Elizabeth Alexander (poet), Ellah Allfrey (Dep. Director, Granta magazine), Russell L. Goings (Poet, entrepreneur,) and Glenna Luschei (Poet, editor, and translator) and Peter Rorvik (Director, Centre for Creative Arts, South Africa).

Six internationally renowned writers serve on the Editorial Board for the Series. Ghanaian-born poet Kwame Dawes, as the founding Series Editor;South African poet Gabeba Baderoon;American novelist John Keene;Nigerian poet and novelistChris Abani; Egyptian-American poet Matthew Shenoda; and British-Nigerian poet Bernardine Evaristo.
